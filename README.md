# Car-and-pedestrian-tracking
This project is a Python-based application for detecting and tracking cars and pedestrians in videos using the OpenCV library. The program leverages pre-trained classifiers to identify objects of interest and visually highlights them with bounding boxes.

## Features
* Real-time detection and tracking of:
* * Cars
  * Pedestrians
*Highlights detected objects using colored rectangles:
* * Blue and Red: Cars
* * Yellow: Pedestrians
* Works with any video input that includes visible cars and pedestrians.
* Easy integration with custom datasets.
